# World-Happiness-Report-Model

This project creates a model predicting healthy life expectancy at birth of a country given the statistics from the World Happiness Report and was done by Tiffany Nguyen and Larissa Zhu. 

After performing correlation analysis between the features and label and normalizing the features' distributions, we evaluated the performance of four algorithms for this model: linear regression, KNN, gradient boosting, and random forest. After conducting our analysis, we concluded that random forest performed the best for this problem and data set with an average R2 value of 0.90.
